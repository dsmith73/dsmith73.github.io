/*
Regular Expressions: Using the Test Method
Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.

If you want to find the word "the" in the string "The dog chased the cat", you could use the following regular expression: /the/. Notice that quote marks are not required within the regular expression.

JavaScript has multiple ways to use regexes. One way to test a regex is using the .test() method. The .test() method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not.

let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
let testRegex = /Code/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true
Apply the regex myRegex on the string myString using the .test() method.
*/

let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString) 



/*
Regular Expressions: Match Literal Strings
In the last challenge, you searched for the word "Hello" using the regular expression /Hello/. That regex searched for a literal match of the string "Hello". Here's another example searching for a literal match of the string "Kevin":

let testStr = "Hello, my name is Kevin.";
let testRegex = /Kevin/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true
Any other forms of "Kevin" will not match. For example, the regex /Kevin/ will not match "kevin" or "KEVIN".

let wrongRegex = /kevin/;
wrongRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns false
A future challenge will show how to match those other forms as well.

Complete the regex waldoRegex to find "Waldo" in the string waldoIsHiding with a literal match.
*/

let waldoIsHiding = "Somewhere Waldo is hiding in this text.";
let waldoRegex = /Waldo/;
let result = waldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);


/*
Regular Expressions: Match a Literal String with Different Possibilities
Using regexes like /coding/, you can look for the pattern "coding" in another string.

This is powerful to search single strings, but it's limited to only one pattern. You can search for multiple patterns using the alternation or OR operator: |.

This operator matches patterns either before or after it. For example, if you wanted to match "yes" or "no", the regex you want is /yes|no/.

You can also search for more than just two patterns. You can do this by adding more patterns with more OR operators separating them, like /yes|no|maybe/.

Complete the regex petRegex to match the pets "dog", "cat", "bird", or "fish".
*/

let petString = "James has a pet cat.";
let petRegex = /dog|cat|bird|fish/; 
let result = petRegex.test(petString);


/*
Regular Expressions: Ignore Case While Matching
Up until now, you've looked at regexes to do literal matches of strings. But sometimes, you might want to also match case differences.

Case (or sometimes letter case) is the difference between uppercase letters and lowercase letters. Examples of uppercase are "A", "B", and "C". Examples of lowercase are "a", "b", and "c".

You can match both cases using what is called a flag. There are other flags but here you'll focus on the flag that ignores case - the i flag. You can use it by appending it to the regex. An example of using this flag is /ignorecase/i. This regex can match the strings "ignorecase", "igNoreCase", and "IgnoreCase".

Write a regex fccRegex to match "freeCodeCamp", no matter its case. Your regex should not match any abbreviations or variations with spaces.
*/

let myString = "freeCodeCamp";
let fccRegex = /freecodecamp/i; 
let result = fccRegex.test(myString);


/*
Regular Expressions: Extract Matches
So far, you have only been checking if a pattern exists or not within a string. You can also extract the actual matches you found with the .match() method.

To use the .match() method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.

Here's an example:

"Hello, World!".match(/Hello/);
// Returns ["Hello"]
let ourStr = "Regular expressions";
let ourRegex = /expressions/;
ourStr.match(ourRegex);
// Returns ["expressions"]
Note that the .match syntax is the "opposite" of the .test method you have been using thus far:

'string'.match(/regex/);
/regex/.test('string');
Apply the .match() method to extract the word coding.
*/

let extractStr = "Extract the word 'coding' from this string.";
let codingRegex = /coding/; 
let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex);
console.log(result)


/*
Regular Expressions: Find More Than the First Match
So far, you have only been able to extract or search a pattern once.

let testStr = "Repeat, Repeat, Repeat";
let ourRegex = /Repeat/;
testStr.match(ourRegex);
// Returns ["Repeat"]
To search or extract a pattern more than once, you can use the g flag.

let repeatRegex = /Repeat/g;
testStr.match(repeatRegex);
// Returns ["Repeat", "Repeat", "Repeat"]
Using the regex starRegex, find and extract both "Twinkle" words from the string twinkleStar.

Note
You can have multiple flags on your regex like /search/gi
*/

let twinkleStar = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star";
let starRegex = /twinkle/gi; 
let result = twinkleStar.match(starRegex); 
console.log(result)


/*
Regular Expressions: Match Anything with Wildcard Period
Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns. Thinking of all words that match, say, a misspelling would take a long time. Luckily, you can save time using the wildcard character: .

The wildcard character . will match any one character. The wildcard is also called dot and period. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match "hug", "huh", "hut", and "hum", you can use the regex /hu./ to match all four words.

let humStr = "I'll hum a song";
let hugStr = "Bear hug";
let huRegex = /hu./;
huRegex.test(humStr); // Returns true
huRegex.test(hugStr); // Returns true
Complete the regex unRegex so that it matches the strings "run", "sun", "fun", "pun", "nun", and "bun". Your regex should use the wildcard character.
*/

let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
let unRegex = /.un/; // Change this line
let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);
console.log(result)


/*
Regular Expressions: Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities
You learned how to match literal patterns (/literal/) and wildcard character (/./). Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything. There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.

For example, you want to match "bag", "big", and "bug" but not "bog". You can create the regex /b[aiu]g/ to do this. The [aiu] is the character class that will only match the characters "a", "i", or "u".

let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["big"]
bagStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["bag"]
bugStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["bug"]
bogStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns null
Use a character class with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in your regex vowelRegex to find all the vowels in the string quoteSample.

Note
Be sure to match both upper- and lowercase vowels.
*/

let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/gi; 
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); 

for (var i=0; i < result.length; i++) {
    console.log(result[i], i)
}



/*
Regular Expressions: Match Letters of the Alphabet
You saw how you can use character sets to specify a group of characters to match, but that's a lot of typing when you need to match a large range of characters (for example, every letter in the alphabet). Fortunately, there is a built-in feature that makes this short and simple.

Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: -.

For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use [a-e].

let catStr = "cat";
let batStr = "bat";
let matStr = "mat";
let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/;
catStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["cat"]
batStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["bat"]
matStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns null
Match all the letters in the string quoteSample.

Note
Be sure to match both upper- and lowercase letters.
*/

let quoteSample = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
let alphabetRegex = /[a-z]/gi; 
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegex); 


/*
Regular Expressions: Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet
Using the hyphen (-) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. It also works to match a range of numbers.

For example, /[0-5]/ matches any number between 0 and 5, including the 0 and 5.

Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set.

let jennyStr = "Jenny8675309";
let myRegex = /[a-z0-9]/ig;
// matches all letters and numbers in jennyStr
jennyStr.match(myRegex);
Create a single regex that matches a range of letters between h and s, and a range of numbers between 2 and 6. Remember to include the appropriate flags in the regex.
*/

let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
let myRegex = /[h-s2-6]/gi; 
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); 


/*
Regular Expressions: Match Single Characters Not Specified
So far, you have created a set of characters that you want to match, but you could also create a set of characters that you do not want to match. These types of character sets are called negated character sets.

To create a negated character set, you place a caret character (^) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.

For example, /[^aeiou]/gi matches all characters that are not a vowel. Note that characters like ., !, [, @, / and white space are matched - the negated vowel character set only excludes the vowel characters.

Create a single regex that matches all characters that are not a number or a vowel. Remember to include the appropriate flags in the regex.
*/

let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
let myRegex = /[^\daeiou]/gi; 
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); 
console.log(result)


/*
Regular Expressions: Match Characters that Occur One or More Times
Sometimes, you need to match a character (or group of characters) that appears one or more times in a row. This means it occurs at least once, and may be repeated.

You can use the + character to check if that is the case. Remember, the character or pattern has to be present consecutively. That is, the character has to repeat one after the other.

For example, /a+/g would find one match in "abc" and return ["a"]. Because of the +, it would also find a single match in "aabc" and return ["aa"].

If it were instead checking the string "abab", it would find two matches and return ["a", "a"] because the a characters are not in a row - there is a b between them. Finally, since there is no "a" in the string "bcd", it wouldn't find a match.

You want to find matches when the letter s occurs one or more times in "Mississippi". Write a regex that uses the + sign.
*/

let difficultSpelling = "Mississippi";
let myRegex = /s+/gi; // Change this line
let result = difficultSpelling.match(myRegex);
console.log(result)



/*
Regular Expressions: Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times
The last challenge used the plus + sign to look for characters that occur one or more times. There's also an option that matches characters that occur zero or more times.

The character to do this is the asterisk or star: *.

let soccerWord = "gooooooooal!";
let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
let oPhrase = "over the moon";
let goRegex = /go*/; /*
soccerWord.match(goRegex); // Returns ["goooooooo"]
gPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns ["g"]
oPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns null
For this challenge, chewieQuote has been initialized as "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!" behind the scenes. Create a regex chewieRegex that uses the * character to match an uppercase "A" character immediately followed by zero or more lowercase "a" characters in chewieQuote. Your regex does not need flags or character classes, and it should not match any of the other quotes.
*/

let chewieRegex = /Aa*/; 

let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);



/*
Regular Expressions: Find Characters with Lazy Matching
In regular expressions, a greedy match finds the longest possible part of a string that fits the regex pattern and returns it as a match. The alternative is called a lazy match, which finds the smallest possible part of the string that satisfies the regex pattern.

You can apply the regex /t[a-z]*i/ to the string "titanic". This regex is basically a pattern that starts with t, ends with i, and has some letters in between.

Regular expressions are by default greedy, so the match would return ["titani"]. It finds the largest sub-string possible to fit the pattern.

However, you can use the ? character to change it to lazy matching. "titanic" matched against the adjusted regex of /t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"].

Note
Parsing HTML with regular expressions should be avoided, but pattern matching an HTML string with regular expressions is completely fine.

Fix the regex /<.*>/ to return the HTML tag <h1> and not the text "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>". Remember the wildcard . in a regular expression matches any character.
*/

let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
let myRegex = /<.*?>/; 
let result = text.match(myRegex);


/*
Regular Expressions: Find One or More Criminals in a Hunt
Time to pause and test your new regex writing skills. A group of criminals escaped from jail and ran away, but you don't know how many. However, you do know that they stay close together when they are around other people. You are responsible for finding all of the criminals at once.

Here's an example to review how to do this:

The regex /z+/ matches the letter z when it appears one or more times in a row. It would find matches in all of the following strings:

"z"
"zzzzzz"
"ABCzzzz"
"zzzzABC"
"abczzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzabc"
But it does not find matches in the following strings since there are no letter z characters:

""
"ABC"
"abcabc"
Write a greedy regex that finds one or more criminals within a group of other people. A criminal is represented by the capital letter C.
*/

let reCriminals = /C+/g;



/*
Regular Expressions: Match Beginning String Patterns
Prior challenges showed that regular expressions can be used to look for a number of matches. They are also used to search for patterns in specific positions in strings.

In an earlier challenge, you used the caret character (^) inside a character set to create a negated character set in the form [^thingsThatWillNotBeMatched]. Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

let firstString = "Ricky is first and can be found.";
let firstRegex = /^Ricky/;
firstRegex.test(firstString);
// Returns true
let notFirst = "You can't find Ricky now.";
firstRegex.test(notFirst);
// Returns false
Use the caret character in a regex to find "Cal" only in the beginning of the string rickyAndCal.
*/

let rickyAndCal = "Cal and Ricky both like racing.";
let calRegex = /^Cal/; 
let result = calRegex.test(rickyAndCal);



/*
Regular Expressions: Match Ending String Patterns
In the last challenge, you learned to use the caret character to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings.

You can search the end of strings using the dollar sign character $ at the end of the regex.

let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
// Returns true
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
storyRegex.test(noEnding);
// Returns false

/*
Regular Expressions: Match All Letters and Numbers
Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with [a-z]. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.

The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is \w. This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (_).

let longHand = /[A-Za-z0-9_]+/;
let shortHand = /\w+/;
let numbers = "42";
let varNames = "important_var";
longHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
shortHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
longHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
shortHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
These shortcut character classes are also known as shorthand character classes.

Use the shorthand character class \w to count the number of alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.
*/

let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let alphabetRegexV2 = /\w/gi; 
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegexV2).length;

/*
Regular Expressions: Match Everything But Letters and Numbers
You've learned that you can use a shortcut to match alphanumerics [A-Za-z0-9_] using \w. A natural pattern you might want to search for is the opposite of alphanumerics.

You can search for the opposite of the \w with \W. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. This shortcut is the same as [^A-Za-z0-9_].

let shortHand = /\W/;
let numbers = "42%";
let sentence = "Coding!";
numbers.match(shortHand); // Returns ["%"]
sentence.match(shortHand); // Returns ["!"]

Regular Expressions: Restrict Possible Usernames
Usernames are used everywhere on the internet. They are what give users a unique identity on their favorite sites.

You need to check all the usernames in a database. Here are some simple rules that users have to follow when creating their username.

1) Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.

2) The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.

3) Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

4) Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.

Change the regex userCheck to fit the constraints listed above.
*/

let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
// (?=.{2}$) is a positive look-ahead to validate that the string is only 2 characters, thus requiring both characters to be letters  
// (?=.{3,}$) is to allow for only 1 letter is the string is at least 3 characters long  
let userCheck = /((?=.{2}$)[a-z]{2,})|((?=.{3,}$)^[a-z]{1,}\d*$)/gi; 
let result = userCheck.test(username);  // T/F check on validity  
let result = username.match(userCheck);     // match and return all names that fit the patterns  
console.log(result)



/*
Regular Expressions: Match Whitespace
The challenges so far have covered matching letters of the alphabet and numbers. You can also match the whitespace or spaces between letters.

You can search for whitespace using \s, which is a lowercase s. This pattern not only matches whitespace, but also carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it as similar to the character class [ \r\t\f\n\v].

let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
let spaceRegex = /\s/g;
whiteSpace.match(spaceRegex);
// Returns [" ", " "]
Change the regex countWhiteSpace to look for multiple whitespace characters in a string.
*/

let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countWhiteSpace = /\s/g; 
let result = sample.match(countWhiteSpace);




/*
Regular Expressions: Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches
Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk * to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string "ah", your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.

let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4); // Returns true
multipleA.test(A2); // Returns false
Change the regex ohRegex to match the entire phrase "Oh no" only when it has 3 to 6 letter h's.
*/

let ohStr = "Ohhh no";
let ohRegex = /Oh{3,6} no/; 
let result = ohStr.match(ohRegex);





/*
Regular Expressions: Positive and Negative Lookahead
Lookaheads are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. This can be useful when you want to search for multiple patterns over the same string.

There are two kinds of lookaheads: positive lookahead and negative lookahead.

A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it. A positive lookahead is used as (?=...) where the ... is the required part that is not matched.

On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there. A negative lookahead is used as (?!...) where the ... is the pattern that you do not want to be there. The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present.

Lookaheads are a bit confusing but some examples will help.

let quit = "qu";
let noquit = "qt";
let quRegex= /q(?=u)/;
let qRegex = /q(?!u)/;
quit.match(quRegex); // Returns ["q"]
noquit.match(qRegex); // Returns ["q"]
A more practical use of lookaheads is to check two or more patterns in one string. Here is a (naively) simple password checker that looks for between 3 and 6 characters and at least one number:

let password = "abc123";
let checkPass = /(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/;
checkPass.test(password); // Returns true
Use lookaheads in the pwRegex to match passwords that are greater than 5 characters long, do not begin with numbers, and have two consecutive digits.
*/

let sampleWord = "astronaut";
let pwRegex = /(?=^\D)(?=.{6,}).+\d{2}.*/;
let result = sampleWord.match(pwRegex);




/*
Regular Expressions: Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters
Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ().

If you want to find either Penguin or Pumpkin in a string, you can use the following Regular Expression: /P(engu|umpk)in/g

Then check whether the desired string groups are in the test string by using the test() method.

let testStr = "Pumpkin";
let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true
Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of Franklin Roosevelt or Eleanor Roosevelt in a case sensitive manner and it should make concessions for middle names.

Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against myString and either true or false is returned depending on whether the regex matches.

/*
Regular Expressions: Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace
Searching is useful. However, you can make searching even more powerful when it also changes (or replaces) the text you match.

You can search and replace text in a string using .replace() on a string. The inputs for .replace() is first the regex pattern you want to search for. The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.

let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
// Returns "The sky is blue."
You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with dollar signs ($).

"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
// Returns "Camp Code"
Write a regex fixRegex using three capture groups that will search for each word in the string "one two three". Then update the replaceText variable to replace "one two three" with the string "three two one" and assign the result to the result variable. Make sure you are utilizing capture groups in the replacement string using the dollar sign ($) syntax.
