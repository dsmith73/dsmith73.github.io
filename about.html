											<h2>Who I am</h2>
											<h3>and why...</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I always feel like I'm learning, re-learning, or more importantly, 
											<i>just trying to figure something out</i>; and since people are always asking me 
											how I do what I do... I thought I'd toss this out there; with the hope that it helps someone else. 
										</p>
										<p>
											I started playing with code in the early 80s, on a Commodore 64 that my dad 
											bought. He used to get tons of different science magazines, and in particular, Popular 
											Science <i>(I think that was the one)</i> used to send out snippets of binary code in their 
											magazines. Being somewhat unruly, I managed to get grounded for a couple of weeks. So, 
											my friend and I discovered these snips; one such snip was Dig-Dug. I spent so many quarters 
											on that dang game, so when I saw it, I was like <i>"Whoa! Check this out! If we type these 
											pages of 1s and 0s into the computer, we can play Dig-Dug for <b>FREE!!</b></i> 
										</p>
										<p>
											So, we went down to my room, and started typing... line after line... column after column... 
											page after... <b>Wait!</b> Where's the rest of it!? *In another issue of the magazine.</i> Ugh!... 
											We dug out another issue, and another, and this went on for a month or so, until we finally 
											received the last magazine <i>with the last snipped of binary</i>. We saved the `.bin` file on our 
											lovely 5 1/4" floppy <i>(double-density, thanks to my Mom's hole-punch)</i>, and typed in the 
											magical `run` command. The command prompt disappeared, and the colorful arcade-<i>ish</i> Dig-Dug 
											screen appeared. We celebrated for a second, and then started playing. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Unfortunately, we'd missed a 1 or a 0 <i>(or several)</i> somewhere, because the hose would blotch 
											out from time to time, and the exploding creatures were more like a pixelated blocks than the 
											expected KA-BOOM that we expected. But, the game worked! We played that thing for hours... 
										</p>
										<p>
											Ever since that day, I've always been interested in code, and how it can translate those words or 
											dwords into actions.  
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>From there</b>, I moved on to batch files, video-games on my Dad's Amiga <i>(shout out to 
											<code>The Bard's Tale</code>)</i>, and hours of figuring out Windows 1.1, etc... etc...  
										</p>
										<p>
											Needless to say, I grew up on Windows, and never really had much exposure to Linus' invention... Linux.  
										</p>
										<br> 
										<center> 
											<img src="images/dig-dug.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Demo" />
										</center>
										<p>
											<h3>Fast forward to today.</h3>  
											<br>  
											Personally or professionally, I feel like I'm always working with or learning something new in Linux, Ansible, Docker, GO, Javascript, Splunk, Prometheus...; and the list goes on and on...
											<br>  
											I believe that you always have to be learning, growing, and improving, or you're edge will begin to dull.

									<h2><quote>“Fortune fovors the bold” is an off-shoot of the quote<br />
										“Fortes fortuna adiuvat” – first written by Terence, for the play "Phormio"</quote></h2>
									<p>
										Terence's quote appeals to me because it tells us that we 
										have to take chances, and that the greater the chance the 
										greater the reward. If we can learn to take acceptable 
										risks, then fortune will smile upon us. The key is finding 
										out how much risk you can assume before Fortune stops smiling 
										upon you. I challenge each of you to make bolder moves, take 
										greater risks, and test the waters of fate.
